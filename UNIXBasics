UNIX - Introduction
▪ UNIX is an operating system which is a widely used stable, multi-user, multitasking system for servers, desktops and laptops.
▪ There are many different versions of UNIX, with the same basic core of commands. Ex: Solaris, HP/UX.
▪ The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shelland the programs.
▪ Kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system. It allocates time and memory to programs and handles the file store and communications in response to system calls.
▪ Shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel.
▪ Program is either a file or a process. A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). A file is a collection of data. They are created
by users using text editors, running compilers etc.
